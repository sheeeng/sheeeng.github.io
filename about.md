# Introduction

I love the minimalist approach of [Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/).

Previously, I used below [Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) based blogging services. But, somehow I never stick with them.

- [Calepin](http://calepin.co/)
- [Logdown](http://logdown.com/)

I love {% include icon-github.html %}! Then, this project was inspired by {% include icon-github.html username="bradleythughes" %} /
[bradleythughes.github.io](https://github.com/bradleythughes/bradleythughes.github.io) project.

[Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) + [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + [Github](https://www.github.com/) = ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

New to writing using [Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)? Read this [post](https://milanaryal.com/2015/writing-on-github-pages-and-jekyll-using-markdown/) by {% include icon-github.html username="MilanAryal" %}.
